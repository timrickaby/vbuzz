VBuzz - Information Aggregator
------

VBuzz was a small information aggregator application for Windows. I wrote this back in 1999 at the age of 15 while teaching myself Visual Basic and Windows programming. Back then I was involved in the brilliant VB community which featured many talented developers from around the world, all sharing ideas and code from their commercial and hobbyist websites.

As I started to build my own website dedicated to VB coding, I thought it would be great if there was a way to aggregate new updates and information from the many different community websites in once place - a way for everyone to quickly see what was happening across the community using my small auto-starting app. 

I designed the software to read a contents file (.vbuzz) my personal website and populate a UI with the latest information from around the VB community; split into news, code and tutorials. The app was downloaded and used amongst members of the VB community and over the following months I regularly updated the content with the latest news and content.

The plan was to evenutally allow third parties to provide their own feeds but I had moved on to other projects before these features were added. While only small, roughly coded and now obsolete, this was one of my first published applications as a young developer.

The repository now serves as an archive for this early project.
